<p>Even though my üë∫ugly face appears on the navbar of the site, it's not all mine! This is for all others to enjoy using some deeper statistical models in their careers. Nonetheless, it's always nice to introduce myself and my passions.</p>

<p>‚öΩ<b>Futsal, soccer, and futsal</b> were probably my only passions up until 2 years ago. Yet, my paradigm had shifted and I started to become a bit more practical. Subsequently, I was introduced to the power of data üìä(through this hairy dude/professor). I started off as a research assistant. The aim: to address the "ÈÅéÂä¥Ê≠ª" (death by work) dilemma that heavily permeated Japan through meta-analytic procedures. This had become such a problem, that the government had begun enforcing national health checks onto large-corporate organizations. Eventually, after many chance encounters, the model was deployed into the business world.</p>

<p>Working through the data was fascinating. I had never realized that so much insight could be gleaned from carefully collected numbers. The model predicted a wide range of behaviors: <i>"This employee seems like he's stealing from the organization"</i> (later, found that he was using the company van for his side-business); <i>"This employee is on the verge of turning over, there must have been a drastic life change that has occured to him"</i> (turns out he just had a baby, was promoted, felt overwhelmed with his new position, and didn't feel safe to ask his peers).</p>

<p>"This", I thought to myself, "could really be something to change society". From then on, my path was clear: I was going to do my everything to serve others through methodical analysis of data.</p>

<p>Currently, I am an undergraduate studying Statistics and Analytics at <a href="https://www.byu.edu/">Brigham Young University</a>. I have set my sights towards <b>Data Science</b>, <b>Business Analytics</b>, and/or <b>Managemnent Consulting</b> --seeking to move large decisions as far as I can reach. When I'm not studying, I mostly enjoy futsal, reading, and eating <a href = "https://www.google.co.jp/search?num=100&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS729US729&ei=pF9qW_T4DNmGoASrirzACA&q=mapo+tofu+japan&oq=mapo+tofu+japan&gs_l=psy-ab.3..0l3j0i22i30k1l7.6835.8769.0.8891.15.12.0.3.3.0.118.880.8j2.10.0....0...1c.1.64.psy-ab..2.13.894...0i67k1j0i10k1.0.w-1lwmuW_Sg">good food</a> (I'm all about the food).</p>
