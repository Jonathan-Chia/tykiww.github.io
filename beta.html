<p>You discovered this page! Since I only post once a month, I thought it would be fun to create a wind-up page that features posts that I have already created, but haven't deployed yet. These are still un-edited versions of the main posts, so it won't be surprising to find some errors. Scan below and take your pick. Depending on the time period, I may have 0 or even about 10. The rest of my pages will be <a href="https://tykiww.github.io/">here</a>.</p>
