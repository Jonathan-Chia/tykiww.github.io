  <h1>What's this site all about?</h1>

</div>


<p>As a dual-native from the US and Japan, I have been richly blessed by many international outcomes that have stretched my limits to areas that I had previously never dared to touch. These opportunities have led me to take interest in statistics and the power descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive analytics has in enriching the lives of individuals. </p>

<p>This cross-pollination between analytical research methods used by academia and career data scientists studying customer behavior will soon become an inevitable fact of business practice. However, even as the world of data science and business have begun to collide, a wide gap in implementation still exists. </p>

<p>The mission of this website is to be a resource to fill that gap; by learining, then giving. The goal is to be an influence for the business world and enhance the well-being of those around me through data analytics.</p>

<p>Many of these projects display knee-deep tutorials on how to effectively tune parameters on analytical models (mostly in R, some python). Others are just business tools, fun tricks with vizualization, and efficient data-work. Just warm enough for almost anyone to understand the objective, but complex enough to stretch your brain. I hope that my passion will serve as a useful tool to connect that implementation gap.</p>

<p>Otherwise, my main interests include futsal, futsal, and futsal.</p>
