title: About Me
---


As a dual-native from the US and Japan, I have been richly blessed by many international outcomes that have stretched my imagination and limits to areas that I had previously never dared to touch. These opportunities have led me to take interest in statistics and the power that descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive analytics has in enriching the lives of individuals. My goal is to be an influence for the well-being of those around me through data science.


Many of my projects display knee-deep tutorials on how to effectively tune parameters on analytical models. Just warm enough for almost anyone to understand, but complex enough to stretch your brain.

My main interests include futsal, futsal, and futsal.
