As a dual-native from the US and Japan, I have been richly blessed by many international outcomes. These opportunities have led me to take interest in statistics and the power that descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive analytics has in enriching the lives of individuals. My goal is to be an influence in the well-being of those around me through data science.

Many of my projects display knee-deep tutorials on how to effectively tune parameters on analytical models. Just warm enough for almost anyone to understand, but complex enough to stretch your brain.

My main interests include futsal, futsal, and futsal.



I hope you enjoy my rough portfolio!
