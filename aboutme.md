As a dual-native from the US and Japan, I have been richly blessed by many international outcomes that have stretched my limits to areas that I had previously never dared to touch. These opportunities have led me to take interest in statistics and the power that descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive analytics has in enriching the lives of individuals. 

This cross-pollination between analytical research methods used by academia, and career data scientists studying customer behavior will soon become an inevitable fact of business practice. Yet, even as the world of data science and business have begun to collide, there is still a wide gap in implementation. 

The mission of this website is to help fill that gap. By learining, then giving. The goal is to be an influence for the business world and enhance the well-being of those around me through data analytics.

Many of my projects display knee-deep tutorials on how to effectively tune parameters on analytical models. Others are just fun tricks that I have learned with vizualization and efficient data-work. They also serve as quick notes for myself to revisit whenever I need! Just warm enough for almost anyone to understand, but complex enough to stretch your brain. I hope that this will serve as one useful tool amongst the many thousands.

Please Enjoy!

Otherwise, my main interests include futsal, futsal, and futsal. If anyone wants to play, let me know!
