title: About Me/CV
---

Born in Japan, grew up in America and Israel, having also lived Germany, and currently residing in the United Kingdom, I'm quite proud to say that I am a citizen of the world!

Recently finished a **MSc. in Industrial-Organizational and Business Psychology** at the University College London (UCL). My main interests is research in consumer behavior, behavioral economics, and influencing/motivating behavioral change for the public good.

My interest in R comes from my belief in the need for more **reproducibility** and **accountability** in psychological and consumer research that can be attained by using R, GitHub, and other open-source software to facilitate increased **transparency** between researchers and the general public.

Other interests include Soccer/Football, Star Wars, and of course Data Science!
